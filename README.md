Calculaator app with vanilla JS, can perform all basic arithmetics except negative arithmetic (-2 + 1), negative arithmetic. Open to suggestions on how to go about the negative arithmetic
PS: I've tried Parsing an algorithm to denote when Minus "-" means subtractions and when it indicates a negative number.
I must've done something wrong because that didn't work either.
